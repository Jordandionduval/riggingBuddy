# riggingBuddy
A little tool used with Maya to simplify steps of the rigging process.



---

I'm making this tool in order to practice programming as well as to help myself for personal projects. The goal of the Rigging Buddy is to either automate or simplify certain steps of the rigging process.

### Installation
This is currently a work in progress. When the tool will be in a functionning state, I'll be sure to update this page!
<!-- This is commented out, removes symbols before and after to remove comment. 
1. Copy the "jdd_riggingBuddy.py" to your Maya scripts directory:
>MyDocuments\Maya\scripts\

2. Then, within maya, use the following text as a python script to run the tool:
```
import jdd_riggingBuddy as RB
RB.UI()
```
3. *(Optional)* Alternatively, the text can be saved in the custom shelf using maya's script editor. This makes the script a small button in your current shelf so it can easily be accessed later.
